<th>Satellite Communication Applications :
A fleet of commercial communication satellites, are operating over India with communication transponders in C-band, Extended C-band, Ku-band and S-band. These transponders support the services like television, telecommunication, radio networking, strategic communication and societal applications. The prominent users of the transponders are BSNL, Doordarshan, All India Radio, strategic govt. users, public sector units, private VSAT operators, DTH and TV operators, banking and financial institutions, etc.
Under societal applications, ISRO/DOS has supported programmes like Telemedicine, Tele-education and Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programmes which are solely national development oriented with an aim to address specific requirements at different strata of the society.
<br>

Television :
INSAT has been a major catalyst for the expansion of television coverage in India. DOS has made available the required transponders through INSAT/GSAT satellites and through leased capacity to cater to the needs of television service.
<br>
Radio Networking :
Radio Networking (RN) through INSAT provides a reliable high-fidelity programme channels for National as well as Regional Networking. AIR is utilising one C-band transponder of INSAT-3C for uplinking RN carriers across the country.
<br>
Satellite Meteorology :
The meteorological satellite data of INSAT is processed and disseminated by INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) of India Meteorological Department (IMD) At present, INSAT/GSAT satellites carrying meteorological payloads are supporting weather forecasting services. IMDPS is capable to receive and process the data of all three existing geostationary meteorological satellites. The performance of the system has been maintained to the level of 98% operation efficiency (24x365 bases). The output generated by the system is used for efficient and successful forecasting the major weather events, particularly major cyclones in the past.
<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Data obtained from meteorological satellites is used to track cyclones, asses their intensity, make landfall predictions, and forecast extreme weather events. This data is then used for monitoring disaster events and assessing damages.</li>

<li>Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), with an operational name of NavIC (acronym for Navigation with Indian Constellation; also, nƒÅvik 'sailor' or 'navigator' in Indian languages), is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services.</li>

<li>Data received from these satellites is processed in INSAT Meteorological Data Processing (IMDPS) system and generates imageries of all channels and quantitative products such as Cloud Motion Vector (CMV), Water Vapour Wind (WVW), visible/ mid-infrared wind, Wind derived products etc.</li>
